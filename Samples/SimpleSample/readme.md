# SIMPLESAMPLE

# PURPOSE: 
This app demonstrates the most basic use of the AppUpdater component.  The major difference between this sample & IntroSample, is that this sample looks directly looks at the files on the server to detect new updates instead of using a server manifest.
  
# SERVER SETUP:

- Create a folder on the web server. 
- Using the IIS manager, enable Directory Browsing for the new folder.

# BUILD ADVANCEDSAMPLE
 
-  Open the AdvancedSample project.   You may need to re-add the AppUpdater reference.
-  Set the UpdateUrl property on the AppUpdater to point at the folder you created on your server.
-  Re-Build

# CLIENT SETUP:

-  Copy SimpleSample_ClientSetup directory to your client computer.
-  Copy the Simpleample.exe & AppUpdater.dll you just built to the 1.0.0.0 directory on the client

# PERFORM UPDATE:

- Launch the app with AppStart.exe 
- Update the app.  You do NOT need to update the version number in the assemblyinfo file.  Only last modified date/time is used.  
- Copy the new update into the folder you created on your web server.    
- The app will auto-update within 30 seconds.
